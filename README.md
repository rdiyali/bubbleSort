# bubbleSort
Bubble Sort: This program is designed to compare the performance of two sorting methods Bubble Sort and Java's built-in Collections.sort. The program generates a list of 100,000 random integers, sorts it using Bubble Sort, and measures the time taken. It then sorts a copy of the list using Collections.sort and measures the time. The goal is to evaluate the efficiency of Bubble Sort
